I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Computer Vision Center (CVC)](https://www.cvc.uab.es), Barcelona, Spain. I received my Ph.D. degree in July 2024 from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB) and Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), co-supervised by Professor [Yanning Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-wzlS7QAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), Assoc. Prof. [Javier Vazquez Corral](https://jvazquezcorral.github.io/) and Dr. [Luis Herranz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TIUdKu4AAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research focuses on image interpretation and editing, particularly image and video segmentation and color manipulation. My work aims to develop advanced techniques for analyzing and modifying visual content, contributing to applications in computer vision and digital media.
