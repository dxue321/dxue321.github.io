I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern Polytechnical University, working under the guidance of Professor [Yanning Zhang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/ynzhang.html). My research is co-supervised by Dr. [Javier Vazquez Corral](https://www.jvazquez-corral.net/) and Dr. [Luis Herranz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TIUdKu4AAAAJ&hl=en) from the [Computer Vision Center](https://www.cvc.uab.es/) at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain. My primary research interests are in the fields of image interpretation and editing, particularly focusing on image and video segmentation and color manipulation. My work aims to develop advanced techniques for analyzing and modifying visual content, contributing to applications in computer vision and digital media.
