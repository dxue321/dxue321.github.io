<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern Polytechnical University, working under the guidance of Professor [Yanning Zhang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/ynzhang.html). My research is co-supervised by Dr. [Javier Vazquez Corral](https://www.jvazquez-corral.net/) and Dr. [Luis Herranz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TIUdKu4AAAAJ&hl=en) from the [Computer Vision Center](https://www.cvc.uab.es/) at the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, Spain. My primary research interests are in the fields of image interpretation and editing, particularly focusing on image and video segmentation and color manipulation. My work aims to develop advanced techniques for analyzing and modifying visual content, contributing to applications in computer vision and digital media.
